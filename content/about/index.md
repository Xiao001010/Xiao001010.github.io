# About Me

Hi, I'm Hao Xu, a master student majoring in High Performance Computing with Data Science at the University of Edinburgh. I'm interested in data science, machine learning, and high performance computing. I'm also a fan of open-source software and I'm always looking for opportunities to contribute to the community.
